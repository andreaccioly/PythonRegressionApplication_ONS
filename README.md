# PythonRegressionApplication_ONS

ONS Hackathon Challenge files. The challenge was to provide a Data Analytics/Machine Learning solution for two types of problems: Energy Management and/or Meteorological/Climate data management.
We decided to study the impact of the precipitation on ANE (Affluent Natural Energy) for a specific reservoir. We did compare several Linear Regression Models and used the results to create a PowerBI dashboard, comparing the actual x predicted values, identifying trends.
